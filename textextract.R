# Script to extract text from camera trap images
# Code covered by License: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)

# README:
# Some Camera traps embed data in the images themselves without putting it into the EXIF data. 
# This is inconvenient, but the data can still be recovered automatically. This script uses OCR 
# from the Tesseract library to do this.
#
# There are parameters in the code that must be edited by the user (location of images, location
# of text within images, etc). See code comments for details.
#
# If the OCR is not working right, the user may have to edit the Tesseract options. Please see this 
# guide to start: 
# https://docs.ropensci.org/tesseract/articles/intro.html#tesseract-control-parameters
#
# The script uses the ImageMagick library for some minimal pre-processing. If the user needs more, see 
# this guide: 
# https://docs.ropensci.org/magick/articles/intro.html

## Different configurations for tesseract ocr ##
# Standard configuratrion for English text:
eng <- tesseract("eng") 
# Configuration to read temperature strings:
degrees <- tesseract(options = list(tessedit_char_whitelist = "-Â°CF.0123456789",
                                    tessedit_pageseg_mode = 7))

## USER OPTIONS ##
path = "~/Documents/personal/cams/pics/100EK001"  # Change to directory containing images to be processed.
filename_pattern = "JPG"    # Change to match all filenames containing this pattern 
ocr_config = degrees        # Change to specific tesseract configuration you want. 
# text_boundaries = "264x64+900+1233"       # String with the text boundaries, in pixels (Get with an image viewer)
text_boundaries = "300x120+1800+2468"
# See magick::image_crop() for format
